# Hexcode Guesser

## How to play

A color will be prompted for the user in the middle of the screen.
Four possible answers will be presented and you must select the correct on before the timer goes off.

Hexcode guesser is just simple game to learn how hexcodes work and how to recognize them faster.

### Design

This project was designed with Javascript and React. It utilizes react components, react router and bootstraps.
It is entirely frontend focused and doesn't use a backend or any databases.
The intention is to be a purely educational and be a source for learning as well as showcase my abilities to create something like this.

Enjoy!
